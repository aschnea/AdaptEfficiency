# AdaptEfficiency
Side project during PhD looking at how Adaptation (recent sensory experience) impacted information processing and efficiency

Two key metrics used: 1) Information theory (Shannon, 1948) mutual information to quantify how much stimulus information is signaled by individual neurons' responses and joint mutual information by all possible pairs of neurons in the unadapted and adapted state. 2) Linear classifiers, both GLM (2-class) and LDA (3-class) to assess how well stimulus identity could be decoded from population responses in the unadapted and adapted state.
